  I am a junior Android developer looking to hone my skills. I earned a scholarship from Google for Udacity's nano degree in Android development. I graduated in December 2018 as a well-known student of the scholarship cohort. Shortly afterwards, I was onboarded by Udacity as a mentor for future Android students.

  Currently, I am self-studying more difficult Android courses and pursuing my CompTIA A+ certfication. I am currently open to both remote work, and working with very local companies (based in Hernando County, FL)
